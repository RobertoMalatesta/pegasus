{"name":"Pegasus","tagline":"Real time cloud-based geopolitical simulation.","body":"#Pegasus\r\n\r\nPegasus is a real-time geopolitical simulation written in JavaScript using Node.js as the engine and Socket.IO for real time connectivity. Pegasus was written with the purpose of being used as a live feed display for joint crisis war simulation committees.\r\n\r\nPegasus was written with simplicity in mind. The main view of the Pegasus system is a simple map of the world. On this map, unit movements and other important information will be shown. Pop-up windows may be opened to provide additional information.\r\n\r\nPegassus was written to be used at the East Bay MUN conference. However, parties interested in licensing this software for their own use may contact me at 'andrew@andrewpage.me' to discuss any opportunities.\r\n\r\n#Features\r\n##Current\r\n- Real time updating of the map from an external source (possibly Node.js app)\r\n\r\n##Future\r\n- **Game**\r\n\t- Unit movements\r\n\t- Multiple factions\r\n\t- Unit numbers\r\n- **Front End**\r\n\t- Live streamed map with troop counts and movements, as well as placemarkers for important locations.\r\n- **Back End**\r\n\t- Back end service for crisis staff to manage the simulation.\r\n\t- Add/remove factions\r\n\t- Manage troop counts\r\n\r\n#Contributing to Pegasus\r\nIf you would like to contribute code to pegasus, please create a pull request and one of the main contributors to the project will review it and merge it in.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
