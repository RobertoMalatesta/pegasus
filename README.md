#Pegasus

Pegasus is a real-time geopolitical simulation written in JavaScript using Node.js as the engine and Socket.IO for real time connectivity. Pegasus was written with the purpose of being used as a live feed display for joint crisis war simulation committees.

Pegasus was written with simplicity in mind. The main view of the Pegasus system is a simple map of the world. On this map, unit movements and other important information will be shown. Pop-up windows may be opened to provide additional information.
