#Pegasus

Pegasus is a real-time geopolitical simulation written in JavaScript using Node.js as the engine and Socket.IO for real time connectivity. Pegasus was written with the purpose of being used as a live feed display for joint crisis war simulation committees.

Pegasus was written with simplicity in mind. The main view of the Pegasus system is a simple map of the world. On this map, unit movements and other important information will be shown. Pop-up windows may be opened to provide additional information.

Pegassus was written to be used at the East Bay MUN conference. However, parties interested in licensing this software for their own use may contact me at 'andrew@andrewpage.me' to discuss any opportunities.
